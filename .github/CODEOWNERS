# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.
# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most precedence.
# The owner can be github username, github team name, or email address:
# @username, @org/teamname, or user@email.com

# default owners for everything in the repo; unless a later match takes precedence.
